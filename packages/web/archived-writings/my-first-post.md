My old portfolio website looked like this ðŸ‘‡

![Kumar's Old Website](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8754a779546e3c97109c4d15b0c2ca0fcf42a537/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f6d53536b64674b2f4b756d61722d416268697275702e6a7067)

Yea, I see it looks nice and cool, but I had to change it all.

That website was bloated with a combination of jQuery and React ðŸ˜‚ Can you believe it?

Also, it didn't have a blog. I tried adding it there, but it was a failed attempt.

I faced weird bugs like background image not loading and stuff.

> **Confession:** The previous website's code was created using mbrise page builder. I just took the code and React-ified it. And so, fixing stuff was hard. I didn't even know jQuery.

I didn't have the time to rebuild my portfolio website. I was creating a side-project.

I was looking for open source code already available.

# One fine day

[Telmo](http://telmo.online/) open sourced his awesome website. I am really thankful he did it.

He used the below stack.

- Next.js
- Markdown

That's it. It was easy, minimal, supported dark-mode, and was more content focused. Exactly what I wanted.

I used that open source project in my website. You'll see many similarities in his and my website.
