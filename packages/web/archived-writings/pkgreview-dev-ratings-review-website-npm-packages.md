Hey all! 🙌

I am very thrilled to announce the side-project I have been working on since last week...

I named it **[pkgreview.dev](https://pkgreview.dev)**! The complete product was born out of one tweet.

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🔥⚡ Question Time ⚡🔥<br><br>Is there a Star Rating/Review website for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NPM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NPM</a> packages...<br><br>where people could look at reviews before using a library?<br><br>Is it a good idea to build such a website?<br><br>⏳⌛⏳⌛⏳⌛⏳</p>&mdash; Kumar Abhirup (@kumar_abhirup) <a href="https://twitter.com/kumar_abhirup/status/1218860389833723905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

# 🕹 The idea

A lot of people find it very difficult to decide what NPM Package, React Component, Module or Library to use.

**They end up checking on GitHub** to see how active the community is. GitHub does not tell you a clear picture. It is just a part of the picture.

**What people often miss**, is the first-hand experience of the users who have used the library.

`pkgreview.dev` displays all sorts of important metadata of a package (_reviews, ratings, last updated, stargazers, etc._) and also shows `other developers' opinion` about them.

And you can **contribute by posting your review** about the NPM Package. 🎉

# 🔥 Building a Community

The app that you are currently seeing is in its MVP phase.

**To be useful to the masses, we need more reviews.** You, as a developer, can contribute a lot in this process by just posting a review to any useful package.

This project needs the support of the **JavaScript Community**.

**[Login with GitHub (takes two seconds) and write your first review!](https://pkgreview.dev/npm/react)**

**This is my first fast-shipped side project. Please do give me feedback on it! 🙌** This is just a start.

# In my Todolist

- Add support for other package managers like PHP Composer, Docker Hub for Images, PIP for Python, and much more!

- Give maintainers of the package special permissions like replying to the review or reporting it.

- Use AI for creating reviews by reading about the package on the web (eg. GitHub issues, Blogposts, etc.)

- Make UI better and less gimmicky.

I will be able to achieve the goals in the todo list only by your support.

I love positive as well as critical feedback 🙌
